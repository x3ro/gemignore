# gemignore

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/gemignore.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/gemignore)

Gemignore allows you to easily add .gitignore snippets to the .gitignore file in your current working directory. The snippets are taken from [the GitHub gitignore repository](https://github.com/github/gitignore), so if there is anything missing, feel free to fork that repository and create a pull request :)

# Installation

    $ gem install gemignore

# Usage

To search for a .gitignore snippet, simply type

    $ gemignore search linux    # or
	$ gemignore s linux

To list all available snippets run

    $ gemignore list    # or
	$ gemignore l

And finally, to add a snippet to the .gitignore file in the **current working directory**:

    $ gemignore add Global/OSX    # or
    $ gemignore add osx    # or
	$ gemignore a osx

To display usage information you can use

    $ gemignore help
